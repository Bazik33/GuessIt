A simple game written in Xamarin about guessing a number. Only in polish at this moment (english version WIP).

# How to run it

(1) Install Visual Studio or Visual Studio for Mac with Xamarin Support (and Android/iOS SDKs)
(2) Load Zgadnij.sln
(3) Right click on the solution and choose "Restore NuGet Packages"
(4) Select your target (Debug|Any CPU|Zgadnij.Android -> for Android phones, Debug|iPhone|Zgadnij.iOS -> for real iPhones, Debug|iPhoneSimulator|Zgadnij.iOS -> for Xcode iPhone Simulator), build and start debugging using the IDE!
